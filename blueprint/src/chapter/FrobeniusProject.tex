\chapter{A project: Frobenius elements}

\section{Introduction and goal}

I had thought that the existence of Frobenius elements was specific to the theory
of local and global fields, until Joel Riou pointed out
an extremely general result from from Bourbaki's Commutative Algebra
(Chapter V, Section 2, number 2, theorem 2, part (ii)). Here is a formal
statement of the result which we want to get into mathlib.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{}

We state the theorem
below. What is so striking about it is that the only finiteness hypothesis is
on the group which acts; there are no finiteness hypotheses on the rings at all.
